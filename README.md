# BSD System Development Showcase

This C code is designed to demonstrate system development functionalities, showcasing interactions with the operating system at the syscall level, specifically targeting OpenBSD 7.4. It serves as a study base and demonstration, intended for educational purposes only.

## Project Structure

```
ls-0.6.0/
├── Makefile
├── README.md
└── src/
├── Makefile
├── main.c
└── test/
```

    `Makefile`: Top-level Makefile for compiling the project.
	    `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
		    `src/`: Directory containing the source code.
			        `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the source code.
					        `main.c`: Main C code demonstrating system development functionalities.
							        `test/`: Directory for test-related code (if applicable).

									## Compilation

									To compile the project, follow these steps:

									    Navigate to the project root directory:
										    ```
											    cd ls-0.6.0/
												    ```

													    Compile the code using the provided Makefile:
														    ```
															    make all
																    ```

																	This will compile the code using the Makefile located in the `src/` directory, generate the executable, and move it to the `build/` directory.

																	## Running

																	After compiling the code, you can run the executable as follows:

																	```
																	./build/ls
																	```

																	Replace `ls` with any appropriate command-line options as needed for testing and demonstration purposes.

																	## Cleaning Up

																	To clean up generated files and directories, run:
																	```
																	make clean
																	```

																	This will remove compiled binaries, build directories, and any core files generated during testing.

																	## Caution

																	This code is intended for educational purposes only. It demonstrates low-level system interactions and should be used with caution. It is specifically tailored for OpenBSD 7.4 and may not work as intended on other systems.
